# Next.js 15 - Client-side error handling for failed data fetching

This example demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications involving client-side data fetching and error handling.  The `pages/about.js` component fetches data from an API route (`pages/api/data.js`).  The API route is designed to simulate network failures 50% of the time.  This causes the client-side component to fail silently or throw an error, leading to a broken user experience.

## Problem
The primary problem is that `about.js` doesn't handle the case where `fetch('/api/data')` fails. When the fetch fails it throws an error which stops the rendering of the component leading to an unexpected outcome.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper error handling using async/await and try-catch blocks to gracefully handle potential network errors and display a user-friendly message or fallback UI instead of crashing the component.
